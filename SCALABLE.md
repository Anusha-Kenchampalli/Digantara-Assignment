# Scalability 

The Scheduler Microservice is designed to be modular, scalable, and production-friendly.

- **Scalable Architecture:** Each component (MongoDB, Redis, Node.js) runs in separate containers, allowing horizontal scaling by simply adding more service instances.
  
- **Redis as a Coordinator:** When multiple instances of the scheduler are deployed, Redis ensures no two instances run the same job simultaneously, preventing duplicate task execution.

- **Microservice Design:** The service is independent and can be integrated easily into any large-scale system as a background scheduler. Other services can interact through REST APIs or event-driven communication.

- **Persistence with MongoDB:** Job data is stored in MongoDB, ensuring all job information is persistent even after restarts.

- **Containerization:** Using Docker and Docker Compose makes it easy to deploy anywhere — locally or on cloud services like AWS ECS, Kubernetes, or Azure Container Apps.

- **Maintainability:** The code is structured with clear separation of concerns — Redis connection, database schema, and job scheduler logic are modular, making it easy to extend or modify.

This microservice demonstrates knowledge of backend architecture, cron-based scheduling, distributed caching, and containerized deployment — all essential skills for backend or DevOps roles.
